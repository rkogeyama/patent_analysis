These codes are part of an ongoing research on disruptive innovation. Originally, the code aimed to find patterns in patent citations, using Machine Learning. However, the research evolved to identify and examine disruptive innovations in terms of network centrality.

The codes are written in python using jupyter notebook. To calculate centrality measures, I am using <a link='https://graph-tool.skewed.de/'>graph-tool</a>, a very efficient network analysis module.
