Each power unit comprises a gas turbine engine of the gas-coupled type, a hydromechanical fuel control receiving electrical inputs to set a gas generator governor in the fuel control, an engine electronic control, and various engine accessories. The operation of the power plant is normally controlled by the pilot through condition levers and switches on a control quadrant, through a pitch control by which the collective pitch of the rotor blades is controlled, and through a master beeper switch which is operable to trim the setting of an isochronous governor for the rotor system and the gas generator governors. The condition lever of each engine transmits a speed command signal through the electronic control of each power unit to its gas generator governor. A signal of collective pitch transmitted from the rotor control system to each engine electronic control is another factor in setting the governor. The power plant includes a power management control, the principal function of which is to equalize the power outputs of the engines. It also includes the rotor isochronous governor. The power management control receives inputs of rotor system speed command and actual rotor speed and of the torques of the individual engines and transmits a governor trim signal to increase or decrease engine power to the several electronic controls.
